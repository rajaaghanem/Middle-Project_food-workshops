        <p>
          I'm Pnina, a religious Druze woman from the village of Maghar, where I
          was born and raised. I was widowed at a young age and was left to
          raise my three small children on my own. I learned to cook traditional
          Druze recipes as a girl, spending long days in the kitchen with my
          mother and grandmother. Today, I still cook meals for my grown
          children daily, and continue to prepare my family's traditional
          recipes, passed down lovingly through the generations of women. I use
          fresh fruits, vegetables and nuts that grow in my garden in every
          dish. I would love to host you in my home, to share a meal and amazing
          experiences.
