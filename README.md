# Middle-Project_food-workshops

A react project where I built a fully functioning website for my family business.

## About the project

Over one week we had to create our own React app by using a couple of things:

- APIs
- React Router
- Use Hooks
- firebase
- Moment.js
- And more!

## The site :

On the home page user can make a reservation using the calendar, clicking on a free date event open a reservation form.
