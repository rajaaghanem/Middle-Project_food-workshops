# Middle-Project_food-workshops

A react project where I built a fully functioning and responsive website for my family business.
- Link : https://food-workshops.netlify.app/

## About the project

Over one week we had to create our own React app, I did it by using a couple of things:

- APIs
- React Router
- Use Hooks
- Firebase
- Moment.js
- And more!

## The site :

### On the home page user can make a reservation using the calendar, clicking on a free date open a reservation form.
